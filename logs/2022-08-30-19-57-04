  "description": "We present DynAlloy, an extension to the Alloy specification language to describe dynamic properties of systems using actions. Actions allow us to appropriately specify dynamic properties, particularly, properties regarding execution traces, in the style of dynamic logic specifications. We extend Alloy's syntax with a notation for partial correctness assertions, whose semantics relies on an adaptation of Dijkstra's weakest liberal precondition. These assertions, defined in terms of actions, allow us to easily express properties regarding executions, favoring the separation of concerns between the static and dynamic aspects of a system specification. We also extend the Alloy tool in such a way that DynAlloy specifications are also automatically analyzable, as standard Alloy specifications. We present the foundations, two case-studies, and empirical results evidencing that the analysis of DynAlloy specifications can be …",

The second point is a consequence of the static nature of Alloy specifications, and has been partly solved by the developers of Alloy; however, their proposed solution requires a complicated and unstructured characterization of executions.We propose to overcome the first problem by translating relational logic to the equational calculus of fork algebras.

The approach is based on the notion of institution, which enables us to work in an abstract, logic independent, setting. Furthermore, our formalisation makes use of representation maps in order to relate the generic specification of components (e.g., as specified through classes) to the behaviour of actual instances in a dynamic environment. We present the essential characteristics for dealing with dynamic reconfiguration in a logical specification language, indicating their technical and practical motivations.

Thus, the Alloy Analyzer may not be appropriate for the analysis of critical applications where more conclusive results are necessary. Dynamite is an extension of PVS that embeds a complete calculus for Alloy. It also includes extensions to PVS that allow one to improve the proof effort by, for instance, automatically analyzing new hypotheses with the aid of the Alloy Analyzer.

The absence of errors in the analyzed models is relative to the provided scope, so achieving verifiability in larger scopes is necessary in order to provide higher confidence in model correctness. Unfortunately, analysis time usually grows exponentially as the scope is increased. A technique that helps in scaling up bounded verification is parallelization. However, the performance of parallel bounded verification greatly depends on the particular strategy used for partitioning the original analysis problem, which in the context of Alloy is a boolean satisfiability problem.

  "description": "Nowadays, software artifacts are ubiquitous in our lives being an essential part of home appliances, cars, cell phones, and even in more critical activities like aeronautics and health sciences. In this context software failures may produce enormous losses, either economical or, in the worst case, in human lives. Software analysis is an area in software engineering concerned with the application of diverse techniques in order to prove the absence of errors in software pieces. In many cases different analysis techniques are applied by following specific methodological combinations that ensure better results. These interactions between tools are usually carried out at the user level and it is not supported by the tools. In this work we present HeteroGenius, a framework conceived to develop tools that allow users to perform hybrid analysis of heterogeneous software specifications. HeteroGenius was designed prioritising the possibility of adding new specification languages and analysis tools and enabling a synergic relation of the techniques under a graphical interface satisfying several well-known usability enhancement criteria. As a case-study we implemented the functionality of Dynamite on top of HeteroGenius.",

In this paper we propose the use of a language for describing QoS contracts based on convex specification, and a two-phase analysis procedure for evaluating contract satisfaction based on the state of the art techniques used for hybrid system verification.

The work benefits from many recent results on model checking and combined logics for time and knowledge, and focus on the way knowledge relations can be captured from automata-based system specifications. We present a formal language with compositional semantics and the corresponding Model Checking algorithms to model and verify Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) at the knowledge level, and a process for obtaining the global automaton for the concurrent system and the knowledge relations for each agent from a set of local automata that represents the behavior of each agent. Our aim is to describe a model suitable for model checking knowledge in a pre-defined way, but with the advantage that the knowledge relations for this would be extracted directly from the automata-based model.",

Yet, with some notable exceptions, the same cannot be said about its proof theory. Aiming to contribute to the latter, we propose a tableaux based proof calculus for a propositional variant of Reiter’s presentation of reasoning with default rules. Our tableaux based proof calculus is based on a reformulation of the semantics of Reiter’s view of a default theory, i.e., a tuple comprised of a set of sentences and a set of default rules, as a premiss structure. In this premiss structure, sentences stand for definite assumptions, as normally found in the literature, and default rules stand for tentative assumptions, as opposed to rules of inference, as normally found in the literature.

  "description": "Software certification is a widespread concern in Software Engineering for, in many cases, the compliance of software with certain requirements becomes indispensable because of the critical tasks it is supposed to perform. In that respect, formal methods have provided a promising toolset for coping with this issue. However, they are mostly based on monotonic logical frameworks. This imposes some considerations on the manipulation of the corpus of evidence justifying how a piece of software fulfills some critical properties. To provide an example, additional evidence obtained about a software artifact, eg, data gathered from further testing, possibly invalidates previous claims made about it. Within a monotonic reasoning framework, this vitiates further analysis from logical interest 4. Thus, the need to create formal frameworks capable of dealing with such scenarios then becomes indispensable.In view of the above, nonmonotonic reasoning appears as an adequate framework for coping with the class of problems just presented. In brief, nonmonotonic reasoning emerged from the field of Artificial Intelligence, and it was originally motivated by a prevailing discontent in the area with the limits of first order classical logic as a framework for reasoning about action and causation 5. Notwithstanding, this initial motivation was rapidly outgrown and nonmonotonic reasoning became a subject of study in its own right. The underlying philosophy of this type of reasoning is a cogent reflection of the fact that reasoning is not in general reducible to the consequences obtainable from a set of definite claims. Instead, it is also being carried out under some …",

  "description": "Logic has proved essential for formally modeling software based systems. Such formal descriptions, frequently called specifications, have served not only as requirements documentation and formalisation, but also for providing the mathematical foundations for their analysis and the development of automated reasoning tools. Logic is usually studied in terms of its two inherent aspects: syntax and semantics. The relevance of the latter resides in the fact that producing logical descriptions of real-world phenomena, requires people to agree on how such descriptions are to be interpreted and understood by human beings, so that systems can be built with confidence in accordance with their specification. On the more practical side, the metalogical relation between syntax and semantics, determines important aspects of the conclusions one can draw from the application of certain analysis techniques, like model checking. Abstract model theory (i.e., the mathematical perspective on semantics of logical languages) is of little practical value to software engineering endeavours. From our point of view, values (those that can be assigned to constants and variables) should not be just points in a platonic domain of interpretation, but elements that can be named by means of terms over the signature of the specification. In a nutshell, we are not interested in properties that require any semantic information not representable using the available syntax.

Asynchronous Relational Networks (ARNs) is a well-known formal orchestration model, based on hypergraphs, for the description of service-oriented software artefacts. Choreography and orchestration are the two main design principles for the development of distributed software. In this work, we propose Communicating Relational Networks (CRNs), which is a variant of ARNs, but relies on choreographies for the characterisation of the communicational aspects of a software artefact, and for making their automated analysis more efficient.",

  "description": "               The world of software development has become intrinsically heterogeneous. Many formal languages have been made available to help analysts and designers model different aspects of software. Some examples in the logic realm are equational logic and classical first-order logic, propositional temporal logics such as LTL and CTL (and their first-order versions), multimodal logics such as the dynamic logic PDL and its first-order version, etc. One important feature of a specification language is the existence of structuring mechanisms enabling the modular construction of system descriptions. Structured specifications were introduced by Wirsing for first-order logic, and later presented in the language-independent setting of institutions by Sannella and Tarlecki. Afterwards, Borzyszkowski presented sufficient conditions for a calculus for (homogeneous) structured specifications to be complete. These conditions …"

  "description": "Distributed software is becoming more and more dynamic to support applications able to respond and adapt to the changes of their execution environment. For instance, service-oriented computing (SOC) envisages applications as services running over globally available computational resources where discovery and binding between them is transparently performed by a middleware. Asynchronous Relational Networks (ARNs) is a well-known formal orchestration model, based on hypergraphs, for the description of service-oriented software artefacts. Choreography and orchestration are the two main design principles for the development of distributed software. In this work, we propose Communicating Relational Networks (CRNs), which is a variant of ARNs, but relies on choreographies for the characterisation of the communicational aspects of a software artefact, and for making their automated analysis more efficient."
