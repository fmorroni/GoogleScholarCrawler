   "description": "We present DynAlloy, an extension to the Alloy specification language to describe dynamic properties of systems using actions. Actions allow us to appropriately specify dynamic properties, particularly, properties regarding execution traces, in the style of dynamic logic specifications. We extend Alloy's syntax with a notation for partial correctness assertions, whose semantics relies on an adaptation of Dijkstra's weakest liberal precondition. These assertions, defined in terms of actions, allow us to easily express properties regarding executions, favoring the separation of concerns between the static and dynamic aspects of a system specification. We also extend the Alloy tool in such a way that DynAlloy specifications are also automatically analyzable, as standard Alloy specifications. We present the foundations, two case-studies, and empirical results evidencing that the analysis of DynAlloy specifications can be�…",

   "description": "We study a number of restrictions associated with the first-order relational specification language Alloy. The main shortcomings we address are:---the lack of a complete calculus for deduction in Alloy's underlying formalism, the so called relational logic,---the inappropriateness of the Alloy language for describing (and analyzing) properties regarding execution traces.The first of these points was not regarded as an important issue during the genesis of Alloy, and therefore has not been taken into account in the design of the relational logic. The second point is a consequence of the static nature of Alloy specifications, and has been partly solved by the developers of Alloy; however, their proposed solution requires a complicated and unstructured characterization of executions.We propose to overcome the first problem by translating relational logic to the equational calculus of fork algebras. Fork algebras provide a�…",

Dynamite allows one to prove an Alloy assertion from an Alloy specification using PVS, while using the Alloy Analyzer for the automated analysis of hypotheses introduced during the proof process. As a means to assess the usability of the tool, we present a complex case-study based on Zave’s Alloy model of addressing for interoperating networks.",

   "description": "               Dynamic reconfiguration, understood as the ability to manage at run time the live components and how these interact in a system, is a feature that is crucial in various languages and computing paradigms, in particular in object orientation. In this paper, we study a categorical approach for characterising dynamic reconfiguration in a logical specification language. The approach is based on the notion of institution, which enables us to work in an abstract, logic independent, setting. Furthermore, our formalisation makes use of representation maps in order to relate the generic specification of components (e.g., as specified through classes) to the behaviour of actual instances in a dynamic environment. We present the essential characteristics for dealing with dynamic reconfiguration in a logical specification language, indicating their technical and practical motivations. As a motivational example, we use a�…",

   "description": "Automatic analysis of Alloy models is supported by the Alloy Analyzer, a tool that translates an Alloy model to a propositional formula that is then analyzed using off-the-shelf SAT solvers. The translation requires user-provided bounds on the sizes of data domains. The analysis is limited by the bounds and is therefore partial. Thus, the Alloy Analyzer may not be appropriate for the analysis of critical applications where more conclusive results are necessary. Dynamite is an extension of PVS that embeds a complete calculus for Alloy. It also includes extensions to PVS that allow one to improve the proof effort by, for instance, automatically analyzing new hypotheses with the aid of the Alloy Analyzer. Since PVS sequents may get cluttered with unnecessary formulas, we use the Alloy unsat-core extraction feature in order to refine proof sequents.

   "description": "             Bounded verification is a technique associated with the Alloy specification language that allows one to analyze Alloy software models by looking for counterexamples of intended properties, under the assumption that data type domains are restricted in size by a provided bound (called the scope of the analysis). The absence of errors in the analyzed models is relative to the provided scope, so achieving verifiability in larger scopes is necessary in order to provide higher confidence in model correctness. Unfortunately, analysis time usually grows exponentially as the scope is increased. A technique that helps in scaling up bounded verification is parallelization. However, the performance of parallel bounded verification greatly depends on the particular strategy used for partitioning the original analysis problem, which in the context of Alloy is a boolean satisfiability problem.

Its appealing syntax and the support provided by the Alloy Analyzer [Jac02b] tool make model analysis accessible to a public of non-specialists. A model and property are translated to a propositional formula, which is fed to a SAT-solver to search for counterexamples. The translation strongly depends on user-provided bounds for data domains called scopes - the larger the scopes, the more confident the user is about the correctness of the model. Due to the intrinsic complexity of the SAT-solving step, it is often the case that analyses do not scale well enough to remain feasible as scopes grow.",

In particular, we provide a straightforward and clear semantics for promotion, a powerful structuring technique that is often not presented as part of the schema calculus.

   "description": "Nowadays, software artifacts are ubiquitous in our lives being an essential part of home appliances, cars, cell phones, and even in more critical activities like aeronautics and health sciences. In this context software failures may produce enormous losses, either economical or, in the worst case, in human lives. Software analysis is an area in software engineering concerned with the application of diverse techniques in order to prove the absence of errors in software pieces. In many cases different analysis techniques are applied by following specific methodological combinations that ensure better results. These interactions between tools are usually carried out at the user level and it is not supported by the tools. In this work we present HeteroGenius, a framework conceived to develop tools that allow users to perform hybrid analysis of heterogeneous software specifications. HeteroGenius was designed prioritising the possibility of adding new specification languages and analysis tools and enabling a synergic relation of the techniques under a graphical interface satisfying several well-known usability enhancement criteria. As a case-study we implemented the functionality of Dynamite on top of HeteroGenius.",

Our formal foundation for Z employs well established abstract notions of logical systems. This setting has a degree of abstraction that enables us to understand what is the precise semantic relationship between schemas obtained from a schema operator and the schemas it is applied to, in particular with respect to property preservation.             Our formalisation is a powerful setting for capturing structuring mechanisms, even enabling us to formalise promotion.

   "description": "                 Since introduced by Reiter in his seminal 1980 paper: ‘A Logic for Default Reasoning’, the subject of reasoning with default rules has been extensively dealt with in the literature on nonmonotonic reasoning. Yet, with some notable exceptions, the same cannot be said about its proof theory. Aiming to contribute to the latter, we propose a tableaux based proof calculus for a propositional variant of Reiter’s presentation of reasoning with default rules. Our tableaux based proof calculus is based on a reformulation of the semantics of Reiter’s view of a default theory, i.e., a tuple comprised of a set of sentences and a set of default rules, as a premiss structure. In this premiss structure, sentences stand for definite assumptions, as normally found in the literature, and default rules stand for tentative assumptions, as opposed to rules of inference, as normally found in the literature. On this basis, a default consequence is�…",

   "description": "             In component-based design, components and communication mechanisms have a different nature; while the former represent the agents that cooperate to fulfill a certain goal, the latter formalise the communication mechanism through which these agents interact. A proper formalisation of the heterogeneity that arises from this difference requires one to employ the most adequate formalism for each of the parts of a specification and then proceed to merge the parts of the system specification characterised in different languages. The approach we propose in this paper is based on the notion of institution, and makes extensive use of institution representations in order to relate the specifications of components and communication mechanisms, each of which might be expressed in different formalisms.

This work was extended by a number of researchers, Jos� Meseguer among them, who presented General Logics, an abstract framework that complements the model theoretical view of institutions by defining the categorical structures that provide a proof theory for any given logic. In this paper we intend to complete this picture by providing the notion of Satisfiability Calculus, which might be thought of as the semantical counterpart of the notion of proof calculus, that provides the formal foundations for those proof systems that use model construction techniques to prove or disprove a given formula, thus “implementing” the satisfiability relation of an institution.",

   "description": "Software certification is a widespread concern in Software Engineering for, in many cases, the compliance of software with certain requirements becomes indispensable because of the critical tasks it is supposed to perform. In that respect, formal methods have provided a promising toolset for coping with this issue. However, they are mostly based on monotonic logical frameworks. This imposes some considerations on the manipulation of the corpus of evidence justifying how a piece of software fulfills some critical properties. To provide an example, additional evidence obtained about a software artifact, eg, data gathered from further testing, possibly invalidates previous claims made about it. Within a monotonic reasoning framework, this vitiates further analysis from logical interest 4. Thus, the need to create formal frameworks capable of dealing with such scenarios then becomes indispensable.In view of the above, nonmonotonic reasoning appears as an adequate framework for coping with the class of problems just presented. In brief, nonmonotonic reasoning emerged from the field of Artificial Intelligence, and it was originally motivated by a prevailing discontent in the area with the limits of first order classical logic as a framework for reasoning about action and causation 5. Notwithstanding, this initial motivation was rapidly outgrown and nonmonotonic reasoning became a subject of study in its own right. The underlying philosophy of this type of reasoning is a cogent reflection of the fact that reasoning is not in general reducible to the consequences obtainable from a set of definite claims. Instead, it is also being carried out under some�…",

   "description": "Logic has proved essential for formally modeling software based systems. Such formal descriptions, frequently called specifications, have served not only as requirements documentation and formalisation, but also for providing the mathematical foundations for their analysis and the development of automated reasoning tools. Logic is usually studied in terms of its two inherent aspects: syntax and semantics. The relevance of the latter resides in the fact that producing logical descriptions of real-world phenomena, requires people to agree on how such descriptions are to be interpreted and understood by human beings, so that systems can be built with confidence in accordance with their specification. On the more practical side, the metalogical relation between syntax and semantics, determines important aspects of the conclusions one can draw from the application of certain analysis techniques, like model checking. Abstract model theory (i.e., the mathematical perspective on semantics of logical languages) is of little practical value to software engineering endeavours. From our point of view, values (those that can be assigned to constants and variables) should not be just points in a platonic domain of interpretation, but elements that can be named by means of terms over the signature of the specification. In a nutshell, we are not interested in properties that require any semantic information not representable using the available syntax. In this paper we present a framework supporting the proof theoretical formalisation of classes of relational models for behavioural logical languages, whose domains of discourse are guaranteed to be formed�…",

Quantitative attributes can be thought as attributes determining the Quality of Service – QoS provided by a software component published as a service. In this sense, they play a determinant role in classifying software artifacts according to specific needs stated as requirements. In previous works we presented an efficient, and fully automatic, analysis technique for establishing Service Level Agreements – SLA. Such a proposal relays on describing QoS contracts as convex specifications, and compliance checking is performed by the application of an analysis algorithm based on state of the art techniques used in hybrid system verification.

For instance, service-oriented computing (SOC) envisages applications as services running over globally available computational resources where discovery and binding between them is transparently performed by a middleware. Asynchronous Relational Networks (ARNs) is a well-known formal orchestration model, based on hypergraphs, for the description of service-oriented software artefacts. Choreography and orchestration are the two main design principles for the development of distributed software. In this work, we propose Communicating Relational Networks (CRNs), which is a variant of ARNs, but relies on choreographies for the characterisation of the communicational aspects of a software artefact, and for making their automated analysis more efficient.",

   "description": "               Advances in theorem proving have enabled the emergence of a variety of formal developments that, over the years, have resulted in large corpuses of formalizations. For example, the NASA PVS Library is a collection of 55 formal developments written in the Prototype Verification System (PVS) over a period of almost 30�years and containing more than 28000 proofs. Unfortunately, the simple accumulation of formal developments does not guarantee their reusability. In fact, in formal systems with very expressive specification languages, it is often the case that a particular conceptual object is defined in different ways. This paper presents a technique to establish sound connections between formal definitions. Such connections support the possibility of (partial) borrowing of proved results from one formal description into another, improving the reusability of formal developments. The technique is described�…"

   "description": "               The world of software development has become intrinsically heterogeneous. Many formal languages have been made available to help analysts and designers model different aspects of software. Some examples in the logic realm are equational logic and classical first-order logic, propositional temporal logics such as LTL and CTL (and their first-order versions), multimodal logics such as the dynamic logic PDL and its first-order version, etc. One important feature of a specification language is the existence of structuring mechanisms enabling the modular construction of system descriptions. Structured specifications were introduced by Wirsing for first-order logic, and later presented in the language-independent setting of institutions by Sannella and Tarlecki. Afterwards, Borzyszkowski presented sufficient conditions for a calculus for (homogeneous) structured specifications to be complete. These conditions�…"

   "description": "Distributed software is becoming more and more dynamic to support applications able to respond and adapt to the changes of their execution environment. For instance, service-oriented computing (SOC) envisages applications as services running over globally available computational resources where discovery and binding between them is transparently performed by a middleware. Asynchronous Relational Networks (ARNs) is a well-known formal orchestration model, based on hypergraphs, for the description of service-oriented software artefacts. Choreography and orchestration are the two main design principles for the development of distributed software. In this work, we propose Communicating Relational Networks (CRNs), which is a variant of ARNs, but relies on choreographies for the characterisation of the communicational aspects of a software artefact, and for making their automated analysis more efficient."

Asynchronous Relational Nets (ARNs) were presented by Fiadeiro and Lopes with the aim of formalising the elements of an interface theory for service-oriented software designs. The semantics of ARNs was originally given in terms of sequences of sets of actions corresponding to the behaviour of the service. Later, they were given an institution-based semantics where signatures are ARNs and models are morphisms into ground networks, that have no dependencies on external services.

   "description": "Logic has proved essential as a formal language for describing different aspects of software artefacts. These formal descriptions, frequently called specifications, have served not only as requirements documentation but also for proving properties, provided the logical language in which the specification is written has an appropriate reasoning tool. Semantics is an integral part of logic, as providing logical descriptions of real-world phenomena requires people to agree on how these descriptions should be interpreted. In this sense, model theory has been seen as providing the cornerstone for the satisfaction of this need. Model theory is usually understood as the study of classes of mathematical structures satisfying formulae in a formal language of choice. Model theory is a tool for characterising semantic notions, like meaning and truth, associated to syntactic objects, like formulae and proofs, of a corresponding language. From a category theory point of view the model theory of a logic has been formalised as an institution [1]. An institution is a structure〈 Sign, Sen, Mod,{|= Σ} Σ∈| Sign|〉 formed by: 1) a category of signatures Sign, 2) a grammar functor Sen: Sign→ Set providing a set of sentences for each signature, 3) a model functor Mod: Signop→ Cat providing a class of semantic structures for each signature, 4) a family of binary relations {|= Σ} Σ∈| Sign| such that given Σ∈| Sign|,|= Σ⊆| Mod (Σ)|�| Sen (Σ)|, and 5) satisfying that for all σ: Σ→ Σ∈|| Sign||, α∈ Sen (Σ) and M∈ Mod (Σ), M|= Σ Sen (σ)(α) if and only if Mod (σ)(M)|= Σ α.

   "description": "Modularity is a key concept when aiming at good designs. In [1, 2], Parnas extensively discusses how modular designs of software artifacts result in higher quality software by enabling reuse, separation of concerns and better maintainability. Since Parnas’s foundational work, practitioners build software artifacts (and particularly software specifications), modularly. In [3], Goguen and Burstall present a categorical formalization of the abstract model theory of a logic using the formalism of institutions. Institutions provide an abstract view of a logic that enables the study of properties of a formalism independently of notational issues. For instance,[4] surveys interesting results about well-known properties such as interpolation, within the framework of institutions. In [5], Sanella and Tarlecki provide a set of structure-building operations that enable the modular construction of specifications from theories taken from a given institution. In [6], Borzyszkowski presented a logical system for the structure building operations (SBOs) introduced by Sanella and Tarlecki, as well as an extensive discussion on the conditions under which the proposed calculus is complete. Intuitively we would like to consider structured specifications as syntactically sweetened ways of describing a system whose behavior is equivalent to a monolithic non-structured specification. This is not the case in the SBOs presented in [5]. Let us recall their definition: 1) a flat specification is assumed to be a legal structured specification, 2) the union of two structured specifications over the same signature is considered as a structured specification, 3) the translation over a morphism between�…"

M�s aun, las especificaciones l�gicas, por ser formales, contribuyen en la aplicaci�n de m�todos t�cnicas correctas de verificaci�n.  Diversos formalismos han sido desarrollados para lidiar con estos aspectos y muchos de ellos son eficientes en describir ciertas caracter�sticas de los sistemas de software. Por ejemplo, la l�gica temporal, proposicional y de primer order, consigue describir la forma en la que los sistemas de software evolucionan en el tiempo. La l�gica din�mica tambi�n permite la especificaci�n  de sistemas pero lo hace describiendo c�mo los programas transforman el estado del sistema. Estos son s�lo algunos ejemplos de c�mo una l�gica particular permite la especificaci�n de determinados comportamientos de un sistema. La pregunta interesante acerca de este hecho es: Existe un lenguaje ideal para especificar el comportamiento de un sistema? A pesar de que no vamos a concentrarnos en responder esta pregunta, creemos que ese lenguaje debe tener una sintaxis clara y una sem�ntica f�cil de entender, con el prop�sito de facilitar la comprensi�n de especificaciones y la aplicaci�n de m�todos formales.

   "description": "Alloy [Jac02a] is a widely adopted relational modeling language. Its appealing syntax and the support provided by the Alloy Analyzer [Jac02b] tool make model analysis accessible to a public of non-specialists. A model and property are translated to a propositional formula, which is fed to a SAT-solver to search for counterexamples. The translation strongly depends on user-provided bounds for data domains called scopes–the larger the scopes, the more confident the user is about the correctness of the model. Due to the intrinsic complexity of the SAT-solving step, it is often the case that analyses do not scale well enough to remain feasible as scopes grow."
