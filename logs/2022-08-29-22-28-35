  "Descripción": "We present DynAlloy, an extension to the Alloy specification language to describe dynamic properties of systems using actions. Actions allow us to appropriately specify dynamic properties, particularly, properties regarding execution traces, in the style of dynamic logic specifications. We extend Alloy's syntax with a notation for partial correctness assertions, whose semantics relies on an adaptation of Dijkstra's weakest liberal precondition. These assertions, defined in terms of actions, allow us to easily express properties regarding executions, favoring the separation of concerns between the static and dynamic aspects of a system specification. We also extend the Alloy tool in such a way that DynAlloy specifications are also automatically analyzable, as standard Alloy specifications. We present the foundations, two case-studies, and empirical results evidencing that the analysis of DynAlloy specifications can be …",

The main shortcomings we address are:---the lack of a complete calculus for deduction in Alloy's underlying formalism, the so called relational logic,---the inappropriateness of the Alloy language for describing (and analyzing) properties regarding execution traces.The first of these points was not regarded as an important issue during the genesis of Alloy, and therefore has not been taken into account in the design of the relational logic. The second point is a consequence of the static nature of Alloy specifications, and has been partly solved by the developers of Alloy; however, their proposed solution requires a complicated and unstructured characterization of executions.We propose to overcome the first problem by translating relational logic to the equational calculus of fork algebras.

  "Descripción": "               Dynamic reconfiguration, understood as the ability to manage at run time the live components and how these interact in a system, is a feature that is crucial in various languages and computing paradigms, in particular in object orientation. In this paper, we study a categorical approach for characterising dynamic reconfiguration in a logical specification language. The approach is based on the notion of institution, which enables us to work in an abstract, logic independent, setting. Furthermore, our formalisation makes use of representation maps in order to relate the generic specification of components (e.g., as specified through classes) to the behaviour of actual instances in a dynamic environment. We present the essential characteristics for dealing with dynamic reconfiguration in a logical specification language, indicating their technical and practical motivations. As a motivational example, we use a …",

The translation requires user-provided bounds on the sizes of data domains. The analysis is limited by the bounds and is therefore partial. Thus, the Alloy Analyzer may not be appropriate for the analysis of critical applications where more conclusive results are necessary. Dynamite is an extension of PVS that embeds a complete calculus for Alloy. It also includes extensions to PVS that allow one to improve the proof effort by, for instance, automatically analyzing new hypotheses with the aid of the Alloy Analyzer. Since PVS sequents may get cluttered with unnecessary formulas, we use the Alloy unsat-core extraction feature in order to refine proof sequents.

  "Descripción": "             Bounded verification is a technique associated with the Alloy specification language that allows one to analyze Alloy software models by looking for counterexamples of intended properties, under the assumption that data type domains are restricted in size by a provided bound (called the scope of the analysis). The absence of errors in the analyzed models is relative to the provided scope, so achieving verifiability in larger scopes is necessary in order to provide higher confidence in model correctness. Unfortunately, analysis time usually grows exponentially as the scope is increased. A technique that helps in scaling up bounded verification is parallelization. However, the performance of parallel bounded verification greatly depends on the particular strategy used for partitioning the original analysis problem, which in the context of Alloy is a boolean satisfiability problem.

Software analysis is an area in software engineering concerned with the application of diverse techniques in order to prove the absence of errors in software pieces. In many cases different analysis techniques are applied by following specific methodological combinations that ensure better results. These interactions between tools are usually carried out at the user level and it is not supported by the tools. In this work we present HeteroGenius, a framework conceived to develop tools that allow users to perform hybrid analysis of heterogeneous software specifications. HeteroGenius was designed prioritising the possibility of adding new specification languages and analysis tools and enabling a synergic relation of the techniques under a graphical interface satisfying several well-known usability enhancement criteria. As a case-study we implemented the functionality of Dynamite on top of HeteroGenius.",

In contrast, we present a characterisation of Z structuring mechanisms which takes into account the semantic counterpart of their typical syntactic descriptions, based on category theory. Our formal foundation for Z employs well established abstract notions of logical systems. This setting has a degree of abstraction that enables us to understand what is the precise semantic relationship between schemas obtained from a schema operator and the schemas it is applied to, in particular with respect to property preservation.             Our formalisation is a powerful setting for capturing structuring mechanisms, even enabling us to formalise promotion.

Yet, with some notable exceptions, the same cannot be said about its proof theory. Aiming to contribute to the latter, we propose a tableaux based proof calculus for a propositional variant of Reiter’s presentation of reasoning with default rules. Our tableaux based proof calculus is based on a reformulation of the semantics of Reiter’s view of a default theory, i.e., a tuple comprised of a set of sentences and a set of default rules, as a premiss structure. In this premiss structure, sentences stand for definite assumptions, as normally found in the literature, and default rules stand for tentative assumptions, as opposed to rules of inference, as normally found in the literature. On this basis, a default consequence is …",

  "Descripción": "Software certification is a widespread concern in Software Engineering for, in many cases, the compliance of software with certain requirements becomes indispensable because of the critical tasks it is supposed to perform. In that respect, formal methods have provided a promising toolset for coping with this issue. However, they are mostly based on monotonic logical frameworks. This imposes some considerations on the manipulation of the corpus of evidence justifying how a piece of software fulfills some critical properties. To provide an example, additional evidence obtained about a software artifact, eg, data gathered from further testing, possibly invalidates previous claims made about it. Within a monotonic reasoning framework, this vitiates further analysis from logical interest 4. Thus, the need to create formal frameworks capable of dealing with such scenarios then becomes indispensable.In view of the above, nonmonotonic reasoning appears as an adequate framework for coping with the class of problems just presented. In brief, nonmonotonic reasoning emerged from the field of Artificial Intelligence, and it was originally motivated by a prevailing discontent in the area with the limits of first order classical logic as a framework for reasoning about action and causation 5. Notwithstanding, this initial motivation was rapidly outgrown and nonmonotonic reasoning became a subject of study in its own right. The underlying philosophy of this type of reasoning is a cogent reflection of the fact that reasoning is not in general reducible to the consequences obtainable from a set of definite claims. Instead, it is also being carried out under some …",

  "Descripción": "Logic has proved essential for formally modeling software based systems. Such formal descriptions, frequently called specifications, have served not only as requirements documentation and formalisation, but also for providing the mathematical foundations for their analysis and the development of automated reasoning tools. Logic is usually studied in terms of its two inherent aspects: syntax and semantics. The relevance of the latter resides in the fact that producing logical descriptions of real-world phenomena, requires people to agree on how such descriptions are to be interpreted and understood by human beings, so that systems can be built with confidence in accordance with their specification. On the more practical side, the metalogical relation between syntax and semantics, determines important aspects of the conclusions one can draw from the application of certain analysis techniques, like model checking. Abstract model theory (i.e., the mathematical perspective on semantics of logical languages) is of little practical value to software engineering endeavours. From our point of view, values (those that can be assigned to constants and variables) should not be just points in a platonic domain of interpretation, but elements that can be named by means of terms over the signature of the specification. In a nutshell, we are not interested in properties that require any semantic information not representable using the available syntax. In this paper we present a framework supporting the proof theoretical formalisation of classes of relational models for behavioural logical languages, whose domains of discourse are guaranteed to be formed …",

For instance, service-oriented computing (SOC) envisages applications as services running over globally available computational resources where discovery and binding between them is transparently performed by a middleware. Asynchronous Relational Networks (ARNs) is a well-known formal orchestration model, based on hypergraphs, for the description of service-oriented software artefacts. Choreography and orchestration are the two main design principles for the development of distributed software. In this work, we propose Communicating Relational Networks (CRNs), which is a variant of ARNs, but relies on choreographies for the characterisation of the communicational aspects of a software artefact, and for making their automated analysis more efficient.",

In this context software failures may produce enormous losses, either economical or, in the extreme, in human lives. Software analysis is an area in software engineering concerned on the application of different techniques in order to prove the (relative) absence of errors in software artifacts. In many cases these methods of analysis are applied by following certain methodological directives that ensure better results. In a previous work we presented the notion of satisfiability calculus as a model theoretical counterpart of Meseguer's proof calculus, providing a formal foundation for a variety of tools that are based on model construction. The present work shows how effective satisfiability sub-calculi, a special type of satisfiability calculi, can be combined with proof calculi, in order to provide foundations to certain methodological approaches to software analysis by relating the construction of finite counterexamples and the absence of proofs, in an abstract categorical setting.",

  "Descripción": "In software-as-a-service paradigms software systems are no longer monolithic pieces of code executing within the boundaries of an organisation, on the contrary, they are conceived as a dynamically changing collection of services, collectively executing, in pursuit of a common business goal. An essential aspect of service selection is determining whether the Quality of Service (QoS) profile of a service satisfies the QoS requirements of a client. In realistic execution environments, such QoS values might be influenced by external, non-controllable events, making it impossible for the service provider to guarantee that the values characterised by a QoS profile will be met, naturally leading to the need of a probabilistic interpretation of QoS profile. In this work we propose: 1) a model for describing probabilistic QoS profiles based on multivariate continuous probability distributions, 2) a language for describing probabilistic QoS requirements, and 3) an automatic procedure for assessing whether a probabilistic QoS profile satisfies a probabilistic QoS requirement.",

  "Descripción": "Fork algebras are an extension of relation algebras obtained by extending the set of logical symbols with a binary operator called fork. This class of algebras was introduced by Haeberer and Veloso in the early 90's aiming at enriching relation algebra, an already successful language for program specification, with the capability of expressing some form of parallel computation. The further study of this class of algebras led to many meaningful results linked to interesting properties of relation algebras such as representability and finite axiomatizability, among others. Also in the 90's, Veloso introduced a subclass of relation algebras that are expansible to fork algebras, admitting a large number of non-isomorphic expansions, referred to as explosive relation algebras. In this work we discuss some general techniques for constructing algebras of this type.",

In fact, in formal systems with very expressive specification languages, it is often the case that a particular conceptual object is defined in different ways. This paper presents a technique to establish sound connections between formal definitions. Such connections support the possibility of (partial) borrowing of proved results from one formal description into another, improving the reusability of formal developments.

Some examples in the logic realm are equational logic and classical first-order logic, propositional temporal logics such as LTL and CTL (and their first-order versions), multimodal logics such as the dynamic logic PDL and its first-order version, etc. One important feature of a specification language is the existence of structuring mechanisms enabling the modular construction of system descriptions. Structured specifications were introduced by Wirsing for first-order logic, and later presented in the language-independent setting of institutions by Sannella and Tarlecki.

  "Descripción": "Distributed software is becoming more and more dynamic to support applications able to respond and adapt to the changes of their execution environment. For instance, service-oriented computing (SOC) envisages applications as services running over globally available computational resources where discovery and binding between them is transparently performed by a middleware. Asynchronous Relational Networks (ARNs) is a well-known formal orchestration model, based on hypergraphs, for the description of service-oriented software artefacts. Choreography and orchestration are the two main design principles for the development of distributed software. In this work, we propose Communicating Relational Networks (CRNs), which is a variant of ARNs, but relies on choreographies for the characterisation of the communicational aspects of a software artefact, and for making their automated analysis more efficient.",

Asynchronous Relational Nets (ARNs) were presented by Fiadeiro and Lopes with the aim of formalising the elements of an interface theory for service-oriented software designs. The semantics of ARNs was originally given in terms of sequences of sets of actions corresponding to the behaviour of the service. Later, they were given an institution-based semantics where signatures are ARNs and models are morphisms into ground networks, that have no dependencies on external services.

  "Descripción": "Logic has proved essential as a formal language for describing different aspects of software artefacts. These formal descriptions, frequently called specifications, have served not only as requirements documentation but also for proving properties, provided the logical language in which the specification is written has an appropriate reasoning tool. Semantics is an integral part of logic, as providing logical descriptions of real-world phenomena requires people to agree on how these descriptions should be interpreted. In this sense, model theory has been seen as providing the cornerstone for the satisfaction of this need. Model theory is usually understood as the study of classes of mathematical structures satisfying formulae in a formal language of choice. Model theory is a tool for characterising semantic notions, like meaning and truth, associated to syntactic objects, like formulae and proofs, of a corresponding language. From a category theory point of view the model theory of a logic has been formalised as an institution [1]. An institution is a structure〈 Sign, Sen, Mod,{|= Σ} Σ∈| Sign|〉 formed by: 1) a category of signatures Sign, 2) a grammar functor Sen: Sign→ Set providing a set of sentences for each signature, 3) a model functor Mod: Signop→ Cat providing a class of semantic structures for each signature, 4) a family of binary relations {|= Σ} Σ∈| Sign| such that given Σ∈| Sign|,|= Σ⊆| Mod (Σ)|×| Sen (Σ)|, and 5) satisfying that for all σ: Σ→ Σ∈|| Sign||, α∈ Sen (Σ) and M∈ Mod (Σ), M|= Σ Sen (σ)(α) if and only if Mod (σ)(M)|= Σ α.

  "Descripción": "Modularity is a key concept when aiming at good designs. In [1, 2], Parnas extensively discusses how modular designs of software artifacts result in higher quality software by enabling reuse, separation of concerns and better maintainability. Since Parnas’s foundational work, practitioners build software artifacts (and particularly software specifications), modularly. In [3], Goguen and Burstall present a categorical formalization of the abstract model theory of a logic using the formalism of institutions. Institutions provide an abstract view of a logic that enables the study of properties of a formalism independently of notational issues. For instance,[4] surveys interesting results about well-known properties such as interpolation, within the framework of institutions. In [5], Sanella and Tarlecki provide a set of structure-building operations that enable the modular construction of specifications from theories taken from a given institution. In [6], Borzyszkowski presented a logical system for the structure building operations (SBOs) introduced by Sanella and Tarlecki, as well as an extensive discussion on the conditions under which the proposed calculus is complete. Intuitively we would like to consider structured specifications as syntactically sweetened ways of describing a system whose behavior is equivalent to a monolithic non-structured specification. This is not the case in the SBOs presented in [5]. Let us recall their definition: 1) a flat specification is assumed to be a legal structured specification, 2) the union of two structured specifications over the same signature is considered as a structured specification, 3) the translation over a morphism between …",

  "Descripción": "Las lógicas han sido usadas como sistemas formales para especificar sistemas de software. Más aun, las especificaciones lógicas, por ser formales, contribuyen en la aplicación de métodos técnicas correctas de verificación.  Diversos formalismos han sido desarrollados para lidiar con estos aspectos y muchos de ellos son eficientes en describir ciertas características de los sistemas de software. Por ejemplo, la lógica temporal, proposicional y de primer order, consigue describir la forma en la que los sistemas de software evolucionan en el tiempo. La lógica dinámica también permite la especificación  de sistemas pero lo hace describiendo cómo los programas transforman el estado del sistema. Estos son sólo algunos ejemplos de cómo una lógica particular permite la especificación de determinados comportamientos de un sistema. La pregunta interesante acerca de este hecho es: Existe un lenguaje ideal para especificar el comportamiento de un sistema? A pesar de que no vamos a concentrarnos en responder esta pregunta, creemos que ese lenguaje debe tener una sintaxis clara y una semántica fácil de entender, con el propósito de facilitar la comprensión de especificaciones y la aplicación de métodos formales. Entre las propuestas que recopilamos, las instituciones se imponen como un formalismo para razonar entre lógicas, y una institución universal, que permita razonar entre las lógicas interesantes sería la respuesta a nuestra pregunta.
