      "description": "Owing to wake effects, the power production of each turbine in a wind farm is highly coupled to the operating conditions of the other turbines. Wind farm control strategies must take into account these couplings and produce individual power commands for each turbine. In this case, centralized control approaches might be prone to failures due to the high computational burden and communication dependency. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a non-centralized scheme based on splitting the wind farm into almost uncoupled sets of turbines by solving a mixed-integer partitioning problem. In each set of turbines, a model predictive control strategy seeks to optimize the distribution of the power set-points among turbines such that the impact of the power losses due to the wake effect is reduced. Then, a supervisory controller coordinates the generation of each group to satisfy the power demanded by the�…"

      "description": "Keeping the blood glucose levels within the safe range during meals and exercise still represents a major hurdle not only for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but also for Artificial Pancreas (AP) systems. One of the reasons a fully (autonomous) closed-loop solution has not been released onto the market yet is the slow action of current insulin analogs. To partially overcome this limitation, the authors have previously designed a switched control strategy equipped with an insulin-on-board (IOB) safety loop that mitigates meal-related glucose excursions without carbohydrate counting. In this letter, a similar strategy based on a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) control law has been adapted to safely handle also exercise challenges with minimum user intervention. In silico results using the UVA/Padova simulator evidence that the proposed closed-loop scheme is feasible under moderate-intense exercise bouts by�…"

The Business Process Modeling and Notation (BPMN) has been proposed for expressing ETL processes at a conceptual level. A different approach is studied in this paper, where relational algebra (RA), extended with update operations, is used for specifying ETL processes. In this approach, data tasks in an ETL workflow can be automatically translated into SQL queries to be executed over a DBMS. To illustrate this study, the paper addresses the problem of updating Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) with dependencies, that is, the case when updating a SCD table impacts on associated SCD tables. Tackling this problem requires extending the classic RA with update operations. The paper also shows the�…"

It is based on the multidimensional model, where data can be seen as a cube such that each cell contains one or more measures that can be aggregated along dimensions. In a “Big Data” scenario, traditional data warehousing and OLAP operations are clearly not sufficient to address current data analysis requirements, for example, social network analysis. Furthermore, OLAP operations and models can expand the possibilities of graph analysis beyond the traditional graph-based computation. Nevertheless, there is not much work on the problem of taking OLAP analysis to the graph data model."

Often, DWs change in content and structure due to several reasons, like, for instance, changes in a business scenario or technology. For accurate decision-making, a DW model must allow storing and analyzing time-varying data. This paper addresses the problem of keeping track of the history of the data in a DW. For this, first, a formalization of the traditional MD model is proposed and then extended as a generalized temporal MD model. The model comes equipped with a collection of typical online analytical processing (OLAP) operations with temporal semantics, which is formalized for the four classic operations, namely roll-up, dice, project, and drill-across. Finally, the mapping from the generalized temporal model into a relational schema is presented together with an implementation of the temporal OLAP�…"

The model, based on mass and energy balances, represents the dynamic behaviour of hydrogen and oxygen production using electrolysis. The model allows to anticipate operational variables as dynamic responses in the concentrations of the electrolytic cell, and variations in both, level and pressure, at the gas separation chambers due to the change in electric current. The model parameters have been adjusted based on experimental measurements taken from an available prototype and through a suitable identification process. Simulation results replicate the current dynamic response of the experimental self-pressurized electrolyzer assembly. This model proves to be useful in the improvement of the control of gas production rate in this kind of assemblies, both as a validated simulation�…"

It captures not only the nonlinear behavior of the glucose-insulin system, but also intra-patient variations related to daily insulin sensitivity (S I ) changes. To overcome the large inter-subject variability, the model can also be personalized based on a priori patient information. The structure is amenable for linear parameter varying (LPV) controller design, and represents the dynamics from the subcutaneous insulin input to the subcutaneous glucose output. The efficacy of this model is evaluated in comparison with a previous control-oriented model which in turn is an improvement of previous models. Both models are compared in terms of their openand closed-loop differences with respect to the UVA/Padova model. The proposed model outperforms previous T1DM�…"

      "description": "Field Potentials (FP) are easily reached signals that provide information about the brain’s processing. However, FP should be interpreted cautiously since their biophysical bases are complex. The lateral habenula (LHb) is a brain structure involved in the encoding of aversive motivational values. Previous work indicates that the activity of the LHb is relevant for hippocampal-dependent learning. Moreover, it has been proposed that the interaction of the LHb with the hippocampal network is evidenced by the synchronization of LHb and hippocampal FPs during theta rhythm. However, the origin of the habenular FP has not been analyzed. Hence, its validity as a measurement of LHb activity has not been proven. In this work, we used electrophysiological recordings in anesthetized rats and feed-forward modeling to investigate biophysical basis of the FP recorded in the LHb. Our results indicate that the FP in the LHb during theta rhythm is a volume-conducted signal from the hippocampus. This result highlight that FPs must be thoroughly analyzed prior to its biological interpretation and argues against the use of the habenular FP signal as a readout of the activity of the LHb."

The proposed model allows us to simulate the trajectory of a pedestrian avoiding an obstacle from any direction. Together with the methodology specifications, we provide the data set needed for performing the simulations of this kind of pedestrian dynamic system."

The central idea is to use a short-range target which is adjusted dynamically depending on the environment and thus modulating the desired velocity of the agent. This formulation can be implemented over any type of existing pedestrian model, being force-based or rule-based. As an example, we implement a simple instance of the formulation which is adjusted to reproduce previous reported and available experimental data of collision avoidance in scenarios of low density. The proposed minimal model shows good agreement with the real trajectories and other macroscopic observables."

      "description": "In the present work, we study how the number of simulated clients (occupancy) affects the social distance in an ideal supermarket. For this, we account for realistic typical dimensions and process time (picking products and checkout). From the simulated trajectories, we measure events of social distance less than 2 m and its duration. Between other observables, we define a social distance coefficient that informs how many events (of a given duration) suffer each agent in the system. These kinds of outputs could be useful for building procedures and protocols in the context of a pandemic allowing to keep low health risks while setting a maximum operating capacity."

To persist, active memories must be re-stabilized through a process known as reconsolidation. Although there is consistent behavioral evidence about this process in humans, the retrieval process of reconsolidated memories remains poorly understood. In this context, one fundamental question is whether the same or different neurophysiological mechanisms are involved in retrieval of consolidated and reconsolidated memories. Because it has been demonstrated that the exposure to the reconsolidation process may restructure and strengthen memories, we hypothesized distinct neurophysiological patterns during retrieval of reconsolidated memories. In addition, we hypothesized that interfering with the reconsolidation process using a new learning can prevent these neurophysiological changes. To test it�…"

      "description": "Normal aging involves changes in the ability to acquire, consolidate and recall new information. It has been recently proposed that the reconsolidation process is also affected in older adults. Reconsolidation is triggered after reminder presentation, allowing memories to be modified: they can be impaired, strengthened or changed in their content. In young adults it was previously shown that the presentation of repetitive reminders induces memory strengthening one day after reactivation and the presentation of at least one reminder increases memory persistence several days after reactivation. However, until now this process has remained elusive in older adults. We hypothesize that older adults need a stronger reminder to induce memory strengthening through the reconsolidation process than young adults. To test this, we perform a three-day experiment. On day 1, participants learned 15 sound-word associations, on day 2 they received no reminders (NR group), one reminder (R group) or two rounds of reactivations (Rx2 group). Finally, they were tested on day 7. We found that, contrary to our hypothesis, older adults show a memory improvement triggered by repeated labilization/reconsolidation processes to an equal extent than young adults. These results open new perspectives into the use of reconsolidation to improve daily acquired information and the development of therapeutic home used tools to produce memory enhancement in healthy older adults or those with cognitive decline."

In contrast, during sleep, cued reactivation seems to directly stabilize memories. In reconsolidation, incomplete reminders are more effective in reactivating memories than complete reminders by inducing a mismatch, i.e. a discrepancy between expected and actual events. Whether mismatch is likewise detected during sleep is unclear. Here we test whether cued reactivation during sleep is more effective for mismatch-inducing incomplete than complete reminders. We first establish that only incomplete but not complete reminders labilize memories during wakefulness. When complete or incomplete reminders are presented during 40-min sleep, both reminders are equally effective in stabilizing memories.

This type of memory is highly sensitive to aging, the passage of time, forgetfulness, interference and confusion. Furthermore, episodic memory processes are modulated by both anxiety and depression. People's mental health has deteriorated due to the Covid-19 pandemic, showing higher levels in both values. There is a general consensus that pleasant or aversive events are better remembered than neutral events. Regarding false memories, there is no such consensus. Some authors found that emotional content generates more false memories, however, it was also found that negative content reduces false memories. In this study we evaluated the effects of emotional variables, such as anxiety and depression, on memory encoding and consolidation of true and false details of aversive and neutral stories.\""

Preliminary results from our Lab showed that episodic memory formation is impaired by emotional variables, such as anxiety and depression. We hypothesize that sleep hygiene during quarantine positively impacts memory processes and emotional variables. To test this, we perform a 21-day study. Young and older participants were trained on the episodic memory task (video of neutral content). On day 7 they were tested and half of them began a sleep hygiene program. On day 14, participants were trained in a new episodic task and were tested on day 21. We found that young and older adults that received the sleep hygiene treatment had a positive impact on memory performance. Furthermore, older adults had better performance in memory recognition than young adults independently of the hygiene treatment. Moreover, older adults that received the sleep hygiene treatment showed a positive correlation between the total amount of sleep hygiene activities and the amount of correct recognition as well as a negative correlation with false recognition. We did not found a significant effect on emotional variables. These results demonstrate that sleep hygiene can be an effective tool for young and older adults to improve memory, however one-week treatment is not enough to induce emotional improvements."

In recent times, exciting new materials with peculiar nonlinear properties, such as negative nonlinear coefficients and a zero-nonlinearity wavelength, have been demonstrated. Unfortunately, the GNLSE may lead to unphysical results in these cases since, in general, it does not preserve the number of photons and, in the presence of a negative nonlinearity, predicts a blue shift due to Raman scattering. In this paper, we put forth a modified GNLSE that can be used to model the propagation in media with an arbitrary, even negative, nonlinear coefficient. This novel photon-conserving GNLSE (pcGNLSE) ensures preservation of the photon number and can be solved by the same tried and trusted numerical algorithms used for the standard GNLSE. Finally, we compare results for soliton dynamics in fibers with different nonlinear coefficients obtained with the pcGNLSE and the GNLSE."

The derived MI gain is shown to predict some unique features, such as a nonzero gain extending beyond a zero-nonlinearity wavelength and a complex structure of the MI gain spectrum. Analytical results are shown to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations."

Our proposal is based on results derived from the recently introduced photon-conserving nonlinear Schr�dinger equation (NLSE) and relies on the time shift experienced by soliton-like pulses due to SS upon propagation. In particular, a direct measurement of this time shift allows for a precise estimation of the SS parameter. Furthermore, we show that such an approach cannot be tackled by resorting to the NLSE. The proposed method is validated through numerical simulations, in excellent agreement with the analytical model, and results are presented for relevant spectral regions in the near infrared, the telecommunication band, and the mid infrared, and for realistic parameters of available laser sources and waveguides. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of the proposed scheme against deviations expected in real-life experimental conditions, such as pulse shape, pulse peak power, pulsewidth, and/or higher-order linear and nonlinear dispersion."

      "description": "We revisit the complex interplay between the Raman-induced frequency shift (RIFS) and the effect of self-steepening (SS) in the propagation of solitons, and in the framework of an equation that ensures strict conservation of the number of photons. The generalized nonlinear Schr�dinger equation (GNLSE) is shown to severely fail in preserving the number of photons for sub-100-fs solitons, leading to a large overestimation of the frequency shift. Furthermore, when considering the case of a frequency-dependent nonlinear coefficient, the GNLSE also fails to provide a good estimation of the time shift experienced by the soliton. We tackle these shortcomings of the GNLSE by resorting to the recently introduced photon-conserving GNLSE (pcGNLSE) and study the interplay between the RIFS and self-steepening. As a result, we make apparent the impact of higher-order nonlinearities on short-soliton propagation and�…"

      "description": "Waveguides based on metamaterials may exhibit strongly frequency-dependent nonlinearities. In this work, we focus on the phenomenon of modulation instability in this type of waveguide, departing from a new modeling equation that ensures strict conservation of both the energy and photon number of the parametric process. In particular, we analyse the case of a waveguide with a linearly frequency-dependent nonlinear coefficient, revealing unique features such as narrowband and ultra-wideband gain spectra and the suppression of the power cutoff giving rise to an ever-growing MI gain. These markedly distinct regimes are enabled by self-steepening (SS) and manifest themselves depending upon the magnitude and sign of the SS parameter. We believe these findings to be most relevant in the context of mid-IR supercontinuum sources."

      "description": "Successful memory involves not only remembering over time but also keeping memories distinct. Computational models suggest that pattern separation appears as a highly efficient process to discriminate between overlapping memories. Furthermore, lesion studies have shown that the dentate gyrus (DG) participates in pattern separation. However, these manipulations did not allow identifying the neuronal mechanism underlying pattern separation. The development of different neurophotonics techniques, together with other genetic tools, have been useful for the study of the micro-circuit involved in this process. It has been shown that less-overlapped information would generate distinct neuronal representations within the granule cells. However, since glutamatergic nor GABAergic cells in the DG are not functionally or structurally homogeneous, identifying the specific role of the different subpopulations remains elusive. Then, understanding pattern separation requires the ability to manipulate a temporal and spatially specific subset of cells in the DG and ideally to analyze DG cells activity in individuals performing a pattern separation dependent behavioral task. Thus, neurophotonics and calcium imaging techniques in conjunction with activity-dependent promoters and high-resolution microscopy appear as important tools for this endeavor. In this work, we review how different neurophotonics techniques have been implemented in the elucidation of a neuronal network that supports pattern separation alone or in combination with traditional techniques. We discuss the limitation of these techniques, and how other neurophotonic techniques could�…"

      "description": "We observed that both groups described the state of consciousness associated with the experience as similar to wakefulness or even increased. This augmented state was related to a subjective perception of increase in information processing. I-OBEs significantly identified sounds and body vibrations before the OBE was initiated, and thus we suggest that they could be considered aura sensations for OBE initiation. Importantly, we found that I-OBEs showed significantly more positive emotions associated with the experience (like peace and joy) while S-OBEs showed more negative emotions. At present, there is no specific treatment for sleep paralysis. Sleep hygiene is recommended and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are used but they are not always effective⁸. Thus, we propose that the OBE could be used as a way to overcome sleep paralysis."

The BNC acts as a nucleation agent, reducing the cell size but maintaining a similar apparent density of 40.4 � 3.3 kg m−3. Both BNCF and PUF exhibit strain‐rate effect on yield stress and densification strain. The BNCF exhibits localized progressive crushing and reduced friability, causing a remarkable recovery in the transverse direction. Numerical simulations show that functionally graded foams subjected to impact could be designed using different layers of PUF and BNCF to vary energy absorption and acceleration rate. The results�…"

However, models commonly found in the literature are too general and neglect imperfections in the windings. Aiming to predict the stimulation sites in patients requires precise modeling of the electric field (E-field), and a proper calibration to adequate to the empirical data of the particular coil employed. Furthermore, most fabricators do not provide precise information about the coil geometries, and even using X-ray images may lead to subjective interpretations. We measured the three components of the vector magnetic field induced by a TMS figure-8 coil with spatial resolutions of up to 1 mm. Starting from a computerized tomography-based coil model, we applied a multivariate optimization algorithm to automatically modify the original model and obtain�…"

Desde el a�o 2002 hasta el 2018 seg�n datos publicados en el Ministerio de Justicia, la poblaci�n alojada en las c�rceles federales creci� un 111%, mientras que en el mismo periodo la poblaci�n a nivel pa�s, solo creci� un 18%[INDEC, 2018].En virtud de estos incrementos alarmantes en el sistema penitenciario, es importante realizar un estudio en detalle de la poblaci�n carcelaria en Argentina, la tipolog�a de los delitos y su condici�n legal. Desde el a�o 2002 el Sistema Nacional de Estad�sticas sobre Ejecuci�n de la Pena (SNEEP) contribuye con informaci�n peri�dica con respecto a los internos privados de libertad en las c�rceles federales. Pero sin embargo, el an�lisis de las estad�sticas aplicadas son las cl�sicas. El problema reside en que estos an�lisis no reflejan un prorrateo real de las actividades para desarrollar acciones o medidas preventivas para impedir o predecir hechos delictivos."

In this work, a soybean oil derivative, which comes from one of the most abundant crops on Earth, is proposed as PCM. A heat transfer model was developed to compare the performance of the proposed PCM, under the same boundary and initial conditions, with other materials reported in literature that have well-known disadvantages in terms of flammability, renewability, abundance and environmental care. Results showed that its performance was as good as theirs. Nanocapsules of the PCM coated with TiO2 were prepared and characterized physical, thermal and morphologically.

PI was determined by offline viscosity measurements and verified by scanning transmission electron microscopy. The rheological behavior of each reacting system was analyzed and an empirical correlation to predict its apparent viscosity from fundamental reaction parameters was derived. This was achieved successfully for both before and after the PI point. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 60:491–502, 2020. � 2019 Society of Plastics Engineers"

Once consolidated they can enter a new labile state after the presentation of a reminder (cue) of the original memory, followed by a period of re-stabilization (reconsolidation) 2. In both processes, once stabilization/re-stabilization is accomplished the memory cannot be modified3. Currently there are studies that show a rapid stabilization after 30 min4, 5, while others studies show that stabilization occurs after 6h3. However, there are no studies evaluating short and long delays simultaneously. Knowing that there are spontaneous waves of destabilization (without the re-exposure to keys linked to learning) on which the consolidation and memory persistence depend6, here we investigate whether declarative memories in humans suffer spontaneous labilization/stabilization processes after learning or if they�…"

The model, based on mass and energy balances, represents the dynamic behaviour of hydrogen and oxygen production using electrolysis. The model allows to anticipate operational variables as dynamic responses in the concentrations of the electrolytic cell, and variations in both, level and pressure, at the gas separation chambers due to the change in electric current. The model parameters have been adjusted based on experimental measurements taken from an available prototype and through a suitable identification process. Simulation results replicate the current dynamic response of the experimental self-pressurized electrolyzer assembly. This model proves to be useful in the improvement of the control of gas production rate in this kind of assemblies, both as a validated simulation�…"

Computer-assisted surgery (comprising preoperative virtual planning, virtual intraoperative navigation and 3D printing) is a useful tool for this type of surgery. However, we do not know if and how much the final position of the prosthesis differs, in absolute values, from what was planned virtually in the preoperative phase.

      "description": " Currently, simulations of the induced currents in the brain produced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are used to elucidate the regions reached by stimuli. However, models commonly found in the literature are too general and neglect imperfections in the windings. Aiming to predict the stimulation sites in patients requires precise modeling of the electric field (E-field), and a proper calibration to adequate to the empirical data of the particular coil employed. Furthermore, most fabricators do not provide precise information about the coil geometries, and even using X-ray images may lead to subjective interpretations. We measured the three components of the vector magnetic field induced by a TMS figure-8 coil with spatial resolutions of up to 1 mm. Starting from a computerized tomography-based coil model, we applied a multivariate optimization algorithm to automatically modify the original model and obtain�…"

Desde el a�o 2002 el Sistema Nacional de Estad�sticas sobre Ejecuci�n de la Pena (SNEEP) contribuye con informaci�n peri�dica con respecto a los internos privados de libertad en las c�rceles federales. Pero sin embargo, el an�lisis de las estad�sticas aplicadas son las cl�sicas.

In this work, a soybean oil derivative, which comes from one of the most abundant crops on Earth, is proposed as PCM. A heat transfer model was developed to compare the performance of the proposed PCM, under the same boundary and initial conditions, with other materials reported in literature that have well-known disadvantages in terms of flammability, renewability, abundance and environmental care. Results showed that its performance was as good as theirs. Nanocapsules of the PCM coated with TiO2 were prepared and characterized physical, thermal and morphologically. Thermal studies were carried out in a device designed and constructed simulating a water heater, and a reduction of about 70�…"

In the experimental work, a series of reactions were performed with benzoyl peroxide as initiator and at temperatures considered of industrial interest (80�C and 90�C), varying also the reactor stirring level. PI was determined by offline viscosity measurements and verified by scanning transmission electron microscopy. The rheological behavior of each reacting system was analyzed and an empirical correlation to predict its apparent viscosity from fundamental reaction parameters was derived. This was achieved successfully for both before and after the PI point. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 60:491–502, 2020. � 2019 Society of Plastics Engineers"

Once consolidated they can enter a new labile state after the presentation of a reminder (cue) of the original memory, followed by a period of re-stabilization (reconsolidation) 2. In both processes, once stabilization/re-stabilization is accomplished the memory cannot be modified3. Currently there are studies that show a rapid stabilization after 30 min4, 5, while others studies show that stabilization occurs after 6h3. However, there are no studies evaluating short and long delays simultaneously. Knowing that there are spontaneous waves of destabilization (without the re-exposure to keys linked to learning) on which the consolidation and memory persistence depend6, here we investigate whether declarative memories in humans suffer spontaneous labilization/stabilization processes after learning or if they�…"
